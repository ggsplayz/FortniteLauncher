## Usage

1. Download latest build / compile the VS Project.
2. Open the launcher EXE, as-administrator recommended.
3. When prompted, paste your Fortnite build (example; C:\Fortnite), this is the folder that contains FortniteGame and Engine.
4. When prompted, put your mail (if backend needs one)
5. When prompted, put your password (if backend doesnt needs, just put a random bunch)
6. Select a PORT, which needs to be where your local backend is running. You can use [LawinServer](https://github.com/Lawin0129/LawinServer) for example.
